# Library JS

### [Live Preview](https://hebliscode.github.io/libraryJS/) <br>

Library app coded using javascript. It stores your books using localStorage and keeps track of titles, authors, number of pages and if you've already read it or not. <br>
Basic mobile friendly design, i could come back and improve it in the future. Adding cloud storage could be another interesting project. <br>
