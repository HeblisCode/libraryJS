# Library JS

### [Live Preview](https://hebliscode.github.io/libraryJS/) <br>

Library app coded using javascript. It stores your books using localStorage and keeps track of titles, authors, number of pages and if you've already read it or not <br>
In the future i may come back to this project to make it responsive and add a stat menu to show you how many books and pages you've read. <br>
Adding cloud storage could be another interesting project for the future.
